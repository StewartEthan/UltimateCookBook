**GIT GRAVEYARD STATUS**
I started writing this in college to try to get more programming experience, but as I have gone the web development route in the years since and have a heavy preference for JavaScript over Java on front- and back-end, I have no plans at this time to come back to this project. It now exists solely as a memento of my early days as a programmer.

Containing the code for a Java program I wrote for my wife, which does the following:

- displays recipes contained in resources/recipes directory
- allows user to create new recipes to write to resources/recipes directory
- allows user to edit or delete existing recipes
- allows user to search for specific recipes by title
- allows user to specify ingredients and search for recipes containing at least 1 to 4 (user specifies the number) of those ingredients

_UPCOMING_:
- executable JAR as soon as I can debug current issues
- user can select one or more existing recipes and receive a list of all groceries needed to make all those recipes
