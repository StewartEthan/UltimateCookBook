# UltimateCookBook
Containing the code for a Java program I wrote for my wife, which does the following:

-displays recipes contained in resources/recipes directory
-allows user to create new recipes to write to resources/recipes directory
-allows user to edit or delete existing recipes
-allows user to search for specific recipes by title
-allows user to specify ingredients and search for recipes containing at least 1 to 4 (user specifies the number) of those ingredients

UPCOMING:
-executable JAR as soon as I can debug current issues
-user can select one or more existing recipes and receive a list of all groceries needed to make all those recipes
